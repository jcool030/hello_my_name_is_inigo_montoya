because: "The project is to be carried out throughout the session and students are strongly encouraged to
maintain a log if their project activities, as task allocation and project flow are a component of
the final document provided alongside the android application. We suggest students keep track
of duty assignment, with complexity of allocated tasks and completion dates."

Also:  "The document must include the lessons learned (and suggestions) and a table
stating the roles and contributions of team members for each deliverable. You
must add explanations in those cases where you find that the contributions were
not fair"

MAybe we don't need to post the first meetings and such, but we should write down name/date whenever someone finishes a part of the deliverable
